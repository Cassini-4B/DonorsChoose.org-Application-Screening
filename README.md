# DonorsChoose.org-Application-Screening
Kaggle Competition--DonorsChoose.org Application Screening

This is a Kaggle Competition (located here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/donorschoose-application-screening) and is also my project 
for the Introduction to Data Science course with Metis (http://www.thisismetis.com/courses/introduction-to-data-science).

This project entails reviewing project proposals submitted by public school teachers across the US to DonorsChoose.org for 
funding.  These applications are currently being manually reviewed, and this competition was set up to find ways to automate some
of this review process and to help DonorsChoose.org reach as many teachers as possible.  

I chose this project because education is a worthy cause and getting the right resources to teachers to help them to achieve the 
most with their students is an investment in our future.
